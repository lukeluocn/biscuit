## Introduction
This project is primarily designed for extending the functionality of Lark's bitable. Different extension scripts are developed for different scenarios to provide more convenient and flexible features for using bitable.    
Our project is based on the Flask framework and follows the pure frontend development template provided in the [Docs on Multi-dimensional Table Extension Script Development](https://bytedance.feishu.cn/docx/HazFdSHH9ofRGKx8424cwzLlnZc). We design interactive pages to gather necessary information, including personalBaseToken, appToken, and table_id. Additionally, based on the structure provided in the [BaseOpenSDK (Python) Official Documentation](https://bytedance.feishu.cn/wiki/E95iw3QohiOOolkjmXwcVsC5nae), we implement backend scripts using Python. With user interactions on the frontend and data processing on the backend, we achieve various flexible features for the tables.
